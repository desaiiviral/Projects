Current &amp; Past Projects

This repository is a collection of all past & present projects in my goal to be a top Data Scientist. The contents range from my first project with as little has ~100 lines of code all the way to bigger projects with 1k+. All in all its a way for me to measure my progress and document my growth.

### 1.  Tiering NFL Fantasy Football Players
Peronal project of mine where I wanted to find a way to quantify how good a player is compared to similar players. My goal is to use this project as a stepping stone into furthering my statistical knowledge. I want to be able to not only be able to tier players but be able to use some form of regression model that will allow me to predict a player just coming into the league fantasy points for their rookie seasons and allow me to find comparable players.

### 2. NBA Clutch Player Analysis

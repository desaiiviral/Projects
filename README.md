# Projects

This repository is a collection of all past & present projects in my goal to be a top Data Scientist. The contents range from my first project with as little has ~100 lines of code all the way to bigger projects with 1k+. All in all its a way for me to measure my progress and document my growth.

## Table of Contents

### 1.  Tiering NFL Fantasy Football Players
Personal project of mine where I wanted to find a way to quantify how good a player is compared to similar players. My goal is to use this project as a stepping stone into furthering my statistical knowledge. I want to be able to not only be able to tier players but be able to use some form of regression model that will allow me to predict a player just coming into the league fantasy points for their rookie seasons and allow me to find comparable players.

### 2. NBA Clutch Player Analysis
This was a project done for my Statistical Data Analysis class where we were tasked with performing EDA on any dataset we chose. The dataset was obtained through the NBA API and was used to find the shooting patterns and efficiency of clutch players. I built on top of that by trying to cluster the types of clutch players that are in totals league as a way to account for a players defensive skills as well.

### 3. Infant Mortality Rate Prediction
For this project I got to work with a small team of 4 to try to tackle a time series prediction. In this project I was able to use my deeper understanding of statistical knowledge such as training vs testing data sets and model selection to find a suitable SARIMA model.

### 4. AIDs Survival Prediction
